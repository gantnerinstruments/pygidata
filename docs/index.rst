===================

pygidata is a Python wrapper for the Gantner Instruments Data APIs.

It simplifies access to the measurements by providing an interface that encapsulates the underlying
REST and GraphQL API's and its underlying mappings.

It provides tools for data acquisition, processing, storage, and remote management,
enabling efficient integration with Gantner Instruments systems.

To help you get started quickly, we recommend using the provided JupyterLab environment, which supports interactive development and testing.
See the `Overview` section for setup instructions.

The package section describes the modules and submodules of the pygidata package.
